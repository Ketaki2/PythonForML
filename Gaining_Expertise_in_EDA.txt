How to become an expert in Exploratory Data Analysis(Backbone of Data Science project):

More than 60-70% time is gone into Data Analysis->Feature engineering,data cleaning,Feature selection
Exploratory Data Analysis dictates your model accuracy

Techniques to become good at Exploratory Data Analysis:
1.Feature Engineering:
 - Handle the missing values(Have to be good at python,numpy,pandas,seaborn(helps in statistical analysis of the data),matplotlib) -> refer Kaggle kernels,blogs like towardsDataScience
 - Handle categorical features [ In all these steps,try to find out different techniques to handle these scenarios)
2. Practice problems.
3. Practice the same problem with different techniques and see the impact on accuracy
4. Maintain a cheatsheet of your findings and your preferred techniques for each stage in the lifecycle of a data science project
